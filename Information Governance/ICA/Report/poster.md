🛠️ IT Disaster Recovery Process Flow (Explanatory Text)
✅ Start: Incident Detected
A disaster recovery process is initiated when a critical IT or data-related incident is detected—such as a data breach, system outage, cyberattack, or hardware failure.

🔹 Step 1: Incident Detection & Initial Triage
Responsibility: IT Operations / Monitoring Team
The operations team monitors system health and detects anomalies or disruptions. Once an incident is confirmed, it is logged in the incident management system and categorized based on severity.

🔹 Step 2: Activate Disaster Recovery Plan
Responsibility: Disaster Recovery Lead / CISO
Upon confirmation of a disaster-level incident, the DR Lead activates the approved Disaster Recovery Plan. This includes notifying internal teams, engaging third-party support if needed, and initiating recovery procedures for affected systems. Communication protocols are followed to inform stakeholders and minimize confusion.

🔹 Step 3: System Restoration
Responsibility: IT Infrastructure & Application Teams
Technical teams begin restoring affected systems from backups or activating failover systems. Restoration efforts focus on recovering essential services first, ensuring system stability, and verifying data accuracy.

🔹 Step 4: Post-Recovery Validation & Testing
Responsibility: QA / Security Team
After restoration, quality assurance and security teams validate that all systems are functioning correctly and securely. Functional testing confirms service availability, while security checks ensure there are no lingering vulnerabilities.

🔹 Step 5: Incident Review & Documentation
Responsibility: DR Lead / IT Manager
A post-incident review is conducted to assess what happened, how it was handled, and what improvements are needed. The team documents lessons learned, updates the DR plan, and submits a final report to leadership. This ensures continuous improvement and readiness for future incidents.
