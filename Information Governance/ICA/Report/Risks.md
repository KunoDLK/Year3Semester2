## Identified Risks and Mitigations

### 1. Data Breach  
- **Description:** A data breach involves the unauthorised access, theft, or exposure of sensitive health and personal data stored within the app. This can occur through cyber-attacks, insider threats, or system vulnerabilities, potentially exposing user information to malicious actors.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 5 – Health and fitness data is highly valuable and frequently targeted by cybercriminals, making breaches a significant risk.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 5 – A breach could result in severe legal consequences, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and erosion of user trust.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 25 (5 × 5)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Implement end-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.  
- Conduct regular third-party security audits and penetration testing.  
- Apply strict access controls and role-based permissions for internal systems.  
- Maintain a detailed incident response plan with regular testing.  
- Keep all software dependencies and infrastructure up to date with security patches.  
- Provide ongoing cybersecurity training for all employees.  
- Monitor systems continuously for suspicious activity and potential breaches.

### 2. Inadequate Data Governance  
- **Description:** Inadequate data governance refers to the absence of clear, transparent, and enforceable policies and procedures around how data is collected, stored, processed, shared, and protected. This can result in inconsistent practices, reduced partner trust, and increased legal and compliance risks.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – Current concerns from manufacturers and investors indicate a moderate risk level.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Weak governance can lead to regulatory breaches, partner withdrawal, and investor loss.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 12 (3 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Develop and publish a formal Data Governance Framework aligned with GDPR and other relevant regulations.  
- Define clear data ownership, processing responsibilities, and access controls.  
- Implement a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process for all new data features.  
- Establish a Data Governance Committee to oversee compliance and updates.  
- Maintain detailed records of data flows, consent mechanisms, and sharing agreements.  
- Communicate governance policies transparently with partners and stakeholders.

### 3. Insufficient User Consent Management  
- **Description:** This risk involves failing to properly inform users or obtain explicit consent before collecting, processing, or sharing their personal and health data. It includes inadequate consent logging, unclear privacy policies, or lack of options to withdraw consent, all of which can breach data protection laws.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – In a fast-paced development environment, consent mechanisms may be underdeveloped or overlooked.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Breaches of GDPR or similar regulations can result in significant fines, legal action, and reputational harm.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 12 (3 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Implement a clear and user-friendly consent management system within the app.  
- Present users with granular consent options for each type of data collected and shared.  
- Log and timestamp all consent activity, including updates and withdrawals.  
- Allow users to easily review and modify their consent preferences at any time.  
- Regularly audit consent records to ensure alignment with legal requirements.  
- Provide transparent privacy notices explaining how data will be used and shared.

### 4. System Downtime  
- **Description:** System downtime refers to periods when the application or its backend services become unavailable due to technical failures, server issues, or cyber-attacks such as DDoS. This can disrupt user access, delay data syncing, and affect trust and revenue.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – With a small development team, infrastructure issues or vulnerabilities may go unnoticed until failure occurs.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Downtime impacts user experience, may lead to lost subscription revenue, and damages brand reliability.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 12 (3 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Design and deploy a fault-tolerant, scalable cloud-based infrastructure with load balancing.  
- Implement automated failover systems and real-time monitoring tools.  
- Use content delivery networks (CDNs) and DDoS protection services.  
- Schedule regular infrastructure maintenance and updates.  
- Conduct periodic penetration tests and system stress testing.  
- Establish an incident response plan with clear escalation procedures.

### 5. Data Loss or Corruption  
- **Description:** This risk involves accidental or malicious loss, deletion, or corruption of user data due to system failures, software bugs, human error, or integration issues. It could prevent accurate health tracking and disrupt critical services like reporting to healthcare providers.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – The integration of multiple data sources increases complexity and the chance of mishandling or technical errors.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Data loss affects user trust, compromises service quality, and may breach data retention obligations.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 12 (3 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Implement automated, encrypted daily backups with off-site storage.  
- Use redundant cloud storage systems with failover capabilities.  
- Apply real-time data validation and integrity checks during processing.  
- Introduce versioning and recovery mechanisms for critical user data.  
- Conduct regular disaster recovery drills and backup restoration tests.  
- Log all data changes with audit trails for traceability.

### 6. Insufficient Cybersecurity Training  
- **Description:** This risk arises when team members lack ongoing education on current cybersecurity threats, best practices, and compliance requirements. Without proper training, staff may unintentionally expose the organisation to phishing, malware, or data mishandling.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – Some training has been given, but continuous updates are essential in a fast-evolving threat landscape.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 3 – Insufficient awareness can lead to preventable breaches, affecting security and compliance.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 9 (3 × 3)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Schedule regular, role-specific cybersecurity training sessions for all staff.  
- Include topics such as phishing awareness, secure coding, data handling, and password hygiene.  
- Use simulated cyber-attacks to test and reinforce learning outcomes.  
- Track training completion and understanding through assessments.  
- Update training content in line with emerging threats and regulatory changes.  
- Include cybersecurity responsibilities in employee onboarding and performance reviews.

### 7. Unauthorized Data Sharing  
- **Description:** This involves personal or health data being shared with third parties without proper authorisation, whether due to internal error, misconfigured systems, or malicious intent. Such incidents can breach user trust and violate data protection regulations.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 2 – Strong governance reduces the risk, but human or technical errors remain possible.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Unauthorised sharing can lead to regulatory penalties, partner distrust, and reputational harm.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 8 (2 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Enforce strict role-based access controls (RBAC) across all systems.  
- Regularly audit and review data sharing permissions and integrations.  
- Monitor and log all data access and transfer activities.  
- Apply data tagging/classification to restrict sensitive data exposure.  
- Implement automated alerts for unusual or unauthorised data access attempts.  
- Require formal data sharing agreements with all external partners.

### 8. Regulatory Non-compliance  
- **Description:** Regulatory non-compliance involves failing to meet the legal requirements of data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or other regional regulations. This can result from oversight during rapid development or a lack of dedicated compliance oversight.  
- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3 – The fast-paced environment increases the risk of missing legal obligations.  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4 – Non-compliance can result in heavy fines, legal action, enforced service suspension, and reputational damage.  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 12 (3 × 4)  

**Mitigations:**  
- Appoint a dedicated data protection/compliance officer.  
- Conduct regular internal and external compliance audits.  
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for data processing activities (Article 30 registers).  
- Implement a compliance checklist aligned with relevant data protection laws.  
- Monitor legal developments and update policies accordingly.  
- Integrate privacy-by-design principles throughout the development lifecycle.
