## Reasons Why People Don’t Follow Security Policy:

1. What is the issue for the organisation?
2. What is the issue for an employee of the organisation?
3. What possible solution might there be?

### The policy exists solely to protect the company’s legal standing in the case of an incident.
        
1. Employees may not take the policy seriously, leading to inadequate security practices.
2. Employees may feel the policy is irrelevant to their daily tasks, leading to confusion or neglect.
3. Revise the policy to clearly show it's relevance to both the company and the Employee.

### There is a policy, but no one understands it, except the person who wrote it and who has since left the company.

1. Lack of understanding could cause inconsistent and inadequate implementation
2. As no one knows what the police is the employees can't follow it which could cause a situation of non compliance
3. Provide training and resources to ensure all employees understand the policy

### They have never seen or don’t remember having read the security policy.

1. Employees who have never seen or don't remember reading the security policy may inadvertently violate security protocols.
2. Lack of awareness of the policy can lead to unintentional breaches of security measures.
3. It is crucial to implement regular security policy training sessions and reminders to ensure all employees are aware of and understand the security policy.

### Managers are aware of the policy, but their managers do not prioritize or reward a strong security posture, and the disregard trickles down.

1. This could lead to a culture of sloppiness and negligence towards security practices
2. Employees may no see the value in following the policies if there bosses don't
3. Add isentives for the managers to folow the polices 

### People are aware that they are in violation of the security policy, but they believe the policy does not apply to them due to their elevated status or intelligence.

1. Creates a culture where security rules are selectively followed, increasing risk.  
2. Employees may feel resentment or confusion about inconsistent enforcement.  
3. Enforce policies uniformly across all levels and emphasize that security applies to everyone.  

### People are aware that they are in violation of the security policy, but they think the policy is stupid.

1. Employees may deliberately ignore policies, leading to security vulnerabilities.  
2. Employees may feel frustrated and disengaged, reducing compliance.  
3. Gather employee feedback and adjust policies to be both effective and practical.  

### Following the policy gets in the way of getting work done.

1. Employees may find workarounds, weakening security protections.  
2. Frustration can lead to reduced morale and resistance to security measures.  
3. Ensure policies balance security with usability; streamline procedures where possible.  

### They forget what is and isn’t allowed by security policy.

1. Leads to accidental breaches and inconsistent compliance.  
2. Employees may feel overwhelmed and unsure about security expectations.  
3. Provide regular reminders, quick-reference guides, and ongoing training sessions.  

### The security policy is out of sync with the current environment.

1. An outdated policy may fail to address modern threats, leaving gaps in security.  
2. Employees may ignore outdated rules that don’t fit their workflow.  
3. Regularly review and update policies to align with current threats and technologies.  

### There is no security policy.

1. The organization is at high risk of data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.  
2. Employees lack guidance on how to handle security-related situations.  
3. Develop and implement a clear security policy as soon as possible.
